    "## Matrices and Systems of Linear Equations\n",
    "Matrices are a very convenient and efficient way to represent a linear equation or system of equations. Because matrices are used to represent linear equations, the name of the course in which these concepts are first explored in depth is often called \"Linear Algebra.\"  If you have had a course in linear algebra, this will largely be review. However, you will now see how to use the computer to make solving these systems of equations easier.\n",

    "The shorthand afforded by matrix notation becomes apparent. In applications where repeated references are made to a system of equations, the space saved by this notation can be significant. More importantly, we can perform certain operations on matrices just as we might perform those operations on the equations they represent. If you have not had a course in linear algebra and this material is new to you, you should review any text on mathematical economics. In class, I will take some time to explain matrix operations in more detail using the code below. It is important that you have an understanding of how matrix arithmetic works and not rely entirely on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it is worth noting that a tremendous amount of work in economics requires the use of matrix algebra.  Linear regression, which you will encounter in your econometrics courses, is essentially a matrix algebra problem.  That is, performing a least-squares regression involves solving a system of equations that can be represented by matrices.  It is also the case that many non-linear problems such as solving a stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model can be approximated by a linear model and solved very quickly and to a high degree of precision on a computer using matrix algebra techniques.\n",

    "### Solving systems of linear equations using matrix algebra\n",
    "All of the examples that we worked through in the previous section are leading us up to the main purpose of this lecture-- to demonstrate the methods of matrix algebra as they are used to solve systems of linear equations.  The most important aspect of this method of solving linear systems is the concept of the inverse of a matrix.  The importance of the inverse is apparent when we consider the matrix equation we wish to solve.\n",

    "$$A^{-1}Ax = A^{-1}B$$\n",

    "$$x = A^{-1}B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the solution to the system of equations depends critically on whether or not the coefficient matrix, $A$, can be inverted or not. A matrix that can be inverted is called a nonsingular matrix, while one that cannot be inverted is referred to as a singular matrix. Note that a nonsingular matrix must be square (same number of rows and columns). That is, squareness is a necessary condition for the invertibility of a matrix, but it is not sufficient. Not all square matrices are nonsingular, but all nonsingular matricies are square. Also, if an inverse exists, it is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above may lead you to believe that solving linear systems is easy if you can invert a matrix, and that would indeed be true. The catch is that inverting large matrices is extremely difficult without a computer. Even with a computer, very large matrices can take some time to invert.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections, we will demonstrate how to test for nonsingularity and how to use NumPy to solve systems using these methods. You can use the notebook to take notes as we go through the examples. The honest truth is that as a practicing economist it is almost inconceivable that you would need to invert a matrix by hand. (I've never had to!) So we are not going to belabor the point about how to do it by hand. The puprose is to show you how it works in enough detail so that you have a good understanding of what the computer is doing, that you know how to set things up properly to make it do the job, and that you can detect problems in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tests for nonsigularity\n",
    "As stated above, the necessary condition for a matrix to be nonsingular is that it be square, or $n\\times n$.  A sufficient condition for nonsingularity is that all of the rows (and columns) are linearly independent.  That is, there is no way to express any row (or column) as the linear combination of other rows (or columns.
